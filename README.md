# We're All Administrators Now!

Harking back to the days of our youth where we were all obsessed with videogames, hours played, kill/death ratios, secrets, achievements...
We gave all that enjoyment up so that we could survive.

I sometimes talk to my friends about how many emails I can clear in a day, how many phonecalls I make. Working at my desk I was wondering whether I could make something to display these stats. This app is intended to capture some of that love of stats by providing administrators (or really anyone) with an easy way to display this information.
